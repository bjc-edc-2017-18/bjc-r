            The idea of this next activity is to "teach" the finch a series of movements, and then have
            it play them back to us. Once you've opened this <a class="run" href="../../../../prog/robots/finch-gestural-programmer.xml">starter file</a>,
            press the "r" key and tilt the finch in different directions (like you did in the last exercise - 
            tilting the finch's nose down tells it to go forward, tilting it right tells it to turn right, etc.).
            When you're done
            recording, press the spacebar. Then, place your finch on the floor and press "p" to play the series of instructions.
        </p>

	        I'm not an ambi-turner. It's a problem I had since I was a baby. I can't turn left.

        <p>
            Something should seem strange to you. The finch seems to only be able to stop and turn right! Examine the code
            and try to figure out why. When you've determined where the problem is, add the necessary code to allow the finch
            to turn left and go forward/backward.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            When you've got the basic playback working properly, add functionality to allow the user to specify various speeds
            for the finch as he or she is recording. This task will take a bit more programming - you'll need to introduce new
            variables and "when &ltkey&gt key pressed" blocks, as well as to record the speed 
            values along with the orientation information.
