            We would like to add all the numbers from <code>1</code> to <code>N</code>, where <code>N</code> could
            be a big number.  The obvious way to do this is to 
            simply add them up, one by one.

            We can, however, also follow in the footsteps of the young Johann Carl
            Friedrich Gauss, a now-revered 18th century mathematician. As the
            story goes, he was punished by his elementary
            school teacher to do the same exercise: add all the 
            numbers from <code>1</code> to <code>100</code>. 
            The teacher, J. G. Büttner, assumed that the problem
            would take Gauss a long time to do, yet Gauss finished 
            the problem in a matter of seconds. He realized that,
            adding <code>1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 100</code> was the same as 
            adding <code>(1 + 100) + (2 + 99) + (3 + 98) + ... + (50 + 51)</code>.
            Each pair summed up to <code>101</code>, and there were 
            <code>50</code> of these pairs, so he quickly deduced that the 
            answer was &nbsp;<code>101 &times; 50 = 5050</code>.
            Presumably, teacher Büttner wasn't pleased.
        </p>
        <p class="alert quoteOrange">
            In general, if you wanted to add the numbers from <code>1</code> to <code>N</code>, the answer would be 
            <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>(N + 1) &times; (N &divide; 2)</code>,
            <br />
            because there are <code>(N &divide; 2)</code> pairs, each of which add up to <code>(N + 1)</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Imagine that you are playing a game against young Gauss to see who could add numbers from <code>1</code> to <code>N</code> faster:
            he does it his way, while you manually add them one by one. You can either win, lose, or tie in this game.
            What do you think would happen if <code>N</code> is <code>2</code>? If <code>N</code> is <code>10</code>?
            If <code>N</code> is <code>100</code>? If <code>N</code> is one million?
