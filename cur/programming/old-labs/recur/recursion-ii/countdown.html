We want to make the character count down from any number. Here we're going to discuss how we would write the following block that counts down from a number to zero.<br /><img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/prog/say-numbers-block-BYOB.gif" alt="There should be an image here" title="There should be an image here" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab11/Countdown/call_say_numbers.gif"><br /><br />We discussed that we always need a base case. We can think of the base case as when the program is asked to do something SO simple, that it doesn't need to delegate at all. It knows how to do it all by itself. If x is less than 1, we've got that kind of simple case. If x is less than 1 we've decided to just say 0 and be done! <br /><ul><li>NOTE: Whenever you write a recursive procedure, make sure you have a base case! Even experienced programmers will forget - so always double-check!<br /></li>

Say someone gives us a number that isn't less than 1! Say someone gives us the number 13,329,201 - what would we do? <br /><br />"Woah - That seems complicated. I'll just do a small part of the problem and delegate to someone else"<br /><br />So - what we do (below) is say our number (maybe it is 13,329,201) and delegate to a COPY of the function to do the same thing with one number smaller (in our example: 13,329,200).<br /><br /><img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/recur/say-numbers-code-BYOB.jpg" alt="There should be an image here" title="There should be an image here" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab11/Countdown/SayNumbers_full.jpg"><br /><br /><br /></body></html>
