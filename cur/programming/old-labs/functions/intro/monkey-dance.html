            Every good programmer goes through this at some point, and
            we think that you are ready.
            <br />
            <br />
            You need to make a monkey dance.
        </p>

            Load this 
            <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/building-blocks/monkey-dance-starter-with-sound.xml"><span class="snap">snap</span> project</a>.
            (Or, <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/building-blocks/monkey-dance-starter.xml">this</a> 
            is the same thing without the big sound file).
            We've made some starter custom blocks for you, in the "Looks" palette.  Definitely <code>edit...</code>
            them to see what we've done.
            <br /><br />
            And, we've included a few examples of how to put them together for a dance.  Try it out.
        </p>

        <p class="alert quoteGreen">

            Make custom blocks to do complicated steps, or to repeat sets of steps in ways that
            you'll do over and over.  Add inputs to your custom blocks to change your steps in
            interesting ways.
            We've included several monkey costumes in the project that you should use in new steps&mdash;look
            at how we used the costumes in the custom blocks we already created.
        </p>

        <p class="alert quoteGreen">
            You could import your own sounds if you would like.  Go to the <code>Sounds</code> tab above
            the scripting area and drag a sound from your computer.
        </p>

        <p>
            After you've worked on this for a bit, take a moment to look at what other students
            have done and chat.  If you see something nice, spend some time trying to incorporate that design
            into your program.
