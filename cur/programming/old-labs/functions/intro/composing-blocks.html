            You can treat your custom-made blocks like any other block in snap, including
            using them within other block you define.  In fact, bigger programming
            tasks are usually best solved
            by writing simple blocks that are used within slightly more complicated blocks,
            which are in turn used
            in even more complicated blocks, and so on.
        </p>
        <p class="alert quoteGreen">

            We'll look more closely at this sort of <i>composition</i> of blocks
            in a later topic, because it is important.
        </p>
        <p>
            For now, remember the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/draw-square-empty-parameter.png">
            block?  Use it to create a block that draws the petals of a flower, like:
        </p>
        <img class="center" src="/bjc-r/img/drawing/flower-with-6-square-petals.png" alt="flower with 6 square petals">
        <p>
            If you look this flower, you'll see it has 6 squares drawn at equal angles around
            a full 360-degree rotation.
        </p>
        <p class="alert quoteOrange">
            Create the block
            <br />
            <img class="center" src="/bjc-r/img/drawing/draw-square-leaved-flower-empty-paramters.png"
            alt="block: draw square-leaved flower with [] leaves of size []">
            <br />
            that will draw a square-leaved flower with any number of square-shaped petals with
            the specified size.  In this block, you will turn the sprite between calls to
            <code>draw square</code> in a way similar to that in the <code>draw polygon</code> blocks: 
            using an angle of <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/drawing/calculating-turn-angle-for-draw-flower.png"
            alt="360 divided by the number of leaves">.
        </p>

        An invocation of
        <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/drawing/draw-square-leaved-flower-6-50-parameters.png"
        alt="block: draw square-leaved flower with 6 leaves of size 50">
        should draw the example picture above.
