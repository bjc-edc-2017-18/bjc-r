                <div><span>Alphie: </span> I've been thinking about Betsy's impossible statement "The statement I'm making <em>right now</em> is false." </div>
                <div><span>Gamal: </span> You?!  Thinking?  OK, just kidding.</div>
                <div><span>Alphie: </span> Well, I was hungry then. But it's interesting. <em>Betsy's</em> statement was, well, weird.  As I say, I've been thinking about it. Suppose I wrote a block with <code>repeat until</code> in it, and when it was finished, it'd give me some answer I wanted. Is there some way I could just <em>analyze the code</em> without actually running it, to determine if it would ever stop? </div>
                <div><span>Betsy: </span> You mean a "test" like we invented to figure out if Adam was a Truthteller or not? </div>
                <div><span>Alphie: </span> Yeah. Imagine this great program that could look at other programs and figure out if they'd stop or not. </div> 
                <div><span>Gamal: </span> Why would you care? Why not just run it? </div>
                <div><span>Alphie: </span> Well, yeah, but suppose I knew that the calculation would take a long time even if it is going to succeed, but I'd want to avoid wasting all that time if I could know, in advance, that it would <em>never</em> succeed. </div>
                <div><span>Betsy: </span> So.... You'd want to test the algorithm first to see if it even has a chance of succeeding. </div>
                <div><span>Alphie: </span> Yup! Is there some <em>general</em> program that could look at any other I give it, and report whether that program will end or not? </div>
                <div><span>Betsy: </span> I wonder if that's going to turn out a bit like my claim "The statement I'm making <em>right now</em> is false."   </div>
