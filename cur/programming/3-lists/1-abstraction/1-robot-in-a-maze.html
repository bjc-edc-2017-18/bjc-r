            Imagine you're a robot trapped in a maze. You don't have a bird's-eye view so you can see all the possibilities (shown below left). Instead, you're inside it, and the walls are taller than you are (shown below right).<br />

                        <li><em>sequence</em> (several steps done one after another)</li>
                        <li><em>selection</em> (a place where the algorithm does one of two things depending on some condition)</li>
                        <li><em>repetition</em> (the algorithm does the same thing over and over)</li>

                <li>Without using Snap<em>!</em>, consider: Does your algorithm work on the maze in the first picture on this page?  Start at the orange circle, facing north (in the direction of the arrow).  Your goal is to reach the red X.</li>

		<p>One well-known maze algorithm is called "Follow the left wall."  The idea is to keep your left hand touching a wall.  If suddenly your left hand isn't touching a wall, there's a corridor to the left, and in order to keep your hand on the left wall, you turn left and go down the corridor.  If instead you bump into a wall in front of you, then in order to keep your hand on the left wall you'll have to turn right.  (Draw a sketch if that doesn't make sense to you.)  For many mazes, this simple algorithm will eventually get you to the exit.</p>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="5">
                <li>Does the left wall algorithm work for the maze in the first picture?  If not, can you debug it?</li>
            </ol>
		</div>

		<div class="takeItFurther">
            <ol type="A">
                <li>See if you can invent a maze for which the left wall algorithm doesn't work.</li>
            </ol>
