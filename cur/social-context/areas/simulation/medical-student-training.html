In medical school, students are trained to detect and treat huge numbers of problems that occur within the human body. Many times, this often involves using a number of cadavers in order to give the students realistic experiences in their training.<br /><br />One downside of this approach is that the level of participation is limited by the number of cadavers available, especially if the students require cadavers with specific medical illnesses. What if it were possible to have an unlimited number of test subjects with any illness, while still maintaining the level of realism that cadavers provide? Medical training simulations are now gaining popularity that allow for just that. These fake bodies are backed by computers that keep track of pulse rates, respiration rates, and a variety of other bodily functions and provide this data to the students on common medical instruments. It is possible for an instructor to change any of these variables, effectively simulating <span style="font-style: italic;">any physical condition</span> for the students to diagnose and treat. In addition, the fake bodies can be reused as many times as they are needed.<br /></body></html>
