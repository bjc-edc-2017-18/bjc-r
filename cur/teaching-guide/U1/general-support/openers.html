                <li><strong>Make a Prediction</strong><br /> Students predict the result of a piece of code. Students reason through the logic of code. Teachers might use these to introduce a <strong>new concept</strong> or address a common <strong>misconception</strong>. Students reason through the code without the use of a computer. The code may include elements they have not yet used or complicated logic to sort through.</li>
                <li><strong>Debugging</strong><br> Students are presented with code containing an error and must <strong>debug</strong> it. Students gain experience with debugging and must make sense of code. Teachers might use these to point to a common pitfall or teach a debugging strategy. Students reason through code without the use of a computer. The code includes bugs for students to resolve.</li>
                <li><a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/computing-in-the-news.html"><strong>Computing in the News</strong></a><br>  Students are presented with and discuss a current <strong>news</strong> story about computing. Students gain a greater sense of the relevance of computing in society, are exposed to complex social issues, and learn to read news stories with an informed and critical eye. </li>
                <!--<li><strong>Snap Judgment</strong><br> Students <strong>write</strong> down their view in response to a prompt about a Social Implications topic. This is not meant to be polished writing, or even take a view that students firmly believe. The purpose is to engage students and support written communication skills. Throughout the year, students should develop their ability to state a position and provide evidence to support it.</li>-->
